# Dijkstra-Pathfinding-Visualizer

##Prerequisites
1. pygame
2. Dijkstra SSSP algorithm working 
3. priority_queue understanding (DSA)

##About the project 
This program works on Dijkstra SSSP algorithm which is used to find the shortest possible path from a source to any other node in the graph. It is a visualization so we can understand the working of the algorithm in a more understandle manner. The exciting part of this program is that it works under any obstacles configuration and finds out the shortest path avoiding the obstacles between the starting and destination points. 

##Takeaways 
Dijkstra Algorithm is much slower and naive than A* algorithm as A* uses heuristic function to find the best path to follow which makes it resourceful and efficient in many ways.
A* algo is also used in AI so that decision making is done efficiently and faster.
